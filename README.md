# Arduino_MotionDetector
Code for a simple motion detector. 

*PIR-Sensor -> Arduino Nano -> Power Relay*

When Motion is recognized thorugh Arduino Pin #2, the onboard LED Pin #13 will light up. Parallel to that a timer is started, that will set Ouput Pin #3 to switch a relay, powering my LED floor strips.

For the exact wiring, check the links.
